In this example, we have a focal individual called "focal" and they share IBD segments with 6 relatives:
A, B, C are paternal relatives, and they share IBD with the focal individual on haplotype index 0, until a switch error between 59 and 60 cM.
D, E, F are maternal relatives, and they share IBD with the focal individual on haplotype index 1, until a switch error between 59 and 60 cM.

We have a chromosome of length 100 cM.

There are three tiles:
Tile 1: 0 cM -> 19 cM [{A}, {D}]
Tile 2: 20 cM -> 59 cM [{A}, {E}]
tile 3: 60 cM -> 100 cM [{B, C}, {E, F}]
